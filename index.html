        My name is Olaoye Praise, and I was born and grew up in Ibadan , and I'm willing to talk about myself a little even though i don't enjoy it. <br>

        I've always been a curious person,being influenced from the environment i grew up in. From a young age, I found joy in exploring my surroundings,
        asking questions, and seeking answers. <br> Even as curious as i was i didn't enjoy the idea of being taught but accepted it anways just for my parents.
        They encouraged me to pursue my interests with passion and dedication. <br>

        In school, I thrived academically, earning top grades and actively trying to aviod involement in activities. <br> 
        I was always eager to share my insights and perspectives with my peers.

        Beyond academics, I embraced a diverse range of interests, including sports, music, and games.
